### What is inWind Landing Page

inWind Landing Page is a Landing Page template developed for global SaaS projects based on Next.js. It is completely open source, free, and offers perfect SEO and multi-language support.

### Why develop inWind Landing Page

1. First, influenced by the big shot @weijunext, I decided to also open source a Landing Page for everyone to choose from;
2. Secondly, I have also been developing independent B2B websites for traditional factories recently, but my original uni-app development is a SPA project, which is very unfriendly to SEO, so I re-studied Next.js development, which is also a practice project;
3. Finally, I also hope to use this project to meet more global partners. If it is helpful to you or if you need any other help, you can contact me to exchange ideas~

### Performance and SEO

### Third-party libraries used

- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): Used to implement multi-theme switching and some basic styles (recommended for friends who have never used TailwindCSS, you can try it, you can remember fewer class names)
- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): Used to complete most of the animation effects
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): Recommended for React developers, a very convenient and comprehensive icon library
